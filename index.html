    <h3>What is Knitting?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Knitting is a fiber craft that involves using needles to intertwine loops into a fabric, which can be used to create a variety of items, from clothing and accessories to home goods. Knitting has been practiced for centuries, and though its exact origins are unclear, we know it existed as early as the 11th century in Cairo. The craft uses stitches to form the fabric, with two basic stitches:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Knit Stitch</li>
        <li>The Purl Stitch</li>
      </ul>
